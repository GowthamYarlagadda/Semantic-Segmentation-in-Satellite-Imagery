# Semantic-Segmentation-in-Satellite-Imagery


In this project, Using libraries from Keras API and TensorFlow, the training of deep learning model with U-Net architecture, which can predict the land parts with nearly 85% accuracy was accomplished.

This project was done on locally installed tensorflow without gpu support.


## Components of Code 

- Importing Modules
- Data Input
- Labelling
- Defining our CNN Model Layers
- Specifying Optimizers and loss functions
- Training the Model
- saving our model as .hdf5 file for instant access
- Prediction
